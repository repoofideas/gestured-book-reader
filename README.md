### Introduction

Globally, it is estimated that at least 2.2 billion people have some form of visual impairment, and the number is steadily increasing. To address the growing need to access printed text without vision, we present Gestured Book Reader. Our software can read the text from the image, and the interface is optimized for vision-impaired users. By applying computer vision and human-computer interaction technologies such as OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and gesture recognition, our software allows printed text to be read aloud from mobile devices. Users can interact with simple tap or swipe gestures to access features such as changing reading speed, skipping paragraphs, or pause.
