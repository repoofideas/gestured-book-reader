### gestured-book-reader

Globally, it is estimated that at least 2.2 billion people have a vision impairment or blindness, and only about 1.4 million are born blind. This leads to the conclusion that the majority of people with impaired vision will have to learn braille to read, which can be quite challenging. Also, all the books they have collected throughout their lifetime become obsolete. To address these issues, we present a Gestured Book Reader, a software that can read the text from the image, and all the user interaction can be done through the hand gestures captured by the camera. With the recent advancement in mobile phones and OCR(Optical Character Recognition) technology, text recognition with cameras on mobile phones have become widely available. We added features where the user can pause, change the tone, or speed of reading with hand gesture recognition. The goal is to build software that can be used in all mobile platforms where the user can have the printed text read to them naturally without any need for external help or braille.
